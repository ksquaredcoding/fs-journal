# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
```
We got our prject done!
```
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
```
Sockets really are just an extra layer, so having everything done well in the first place makes sockets easy to add.
```
- What are you struggling with?
```
I need to play more with sockets because I only have a very loose understanding of them
```
- What would you count as a victory?
```
Our capstone turned out well and looks pretty polished and will make a great piece in all of our portfolios.
