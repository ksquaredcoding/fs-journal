## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
```
You have an idea of where things will go, what the purpose is and can build towards something. 
```
2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
```
Google, StackOverflow, w3schools, MDN, peers and teachers/assistants
```
3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
```
Don't put too many items in one container, spread things out. Don't write redundantly. Just because something is working, doesn't mean it is right.
