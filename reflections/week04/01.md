> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?
```
When you have to build a massive function that has a pyramid of closing brackets at the end because so much is going on potentially at once. It happens when execution of the functions happens visually from top to bottom.
```
2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?
```
When something waits to happen later. You callback a function when whatever criteria is met so things don't halt page loading for example.
```
3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`
```
Keep code shallow: naming functions can help if there is an error it can point to a named function rather than anonymous.
Modularize: Break code up into different modules so multiple small things do the big thing rather than just-- here's the big thing of code you wanted.
Handle Every Error: A common convention is reserving the first argument in a callback for error handling.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
```
If you're pulling the data over and trying to insert into an array so you can use it, use .map
It'll save a lot of headache.
