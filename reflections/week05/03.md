## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?
```
Preplanning how much time to give to certain tasks.
```
2. What three strategies will you implement and how?
```
Prioritization by seeing which tasks are most important, so I will usually save styling for later more often. Practice and adapt, by making sure I follow timeboxing strategies it starts becoming more second nature, and adapt by figuring out more and more what tasks take what amount of time. Strategic quitting, if something is taking too much time or becoming draining and stopping them frees more time to take on other important tasks.
```
3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 
```
Overworking on one problem when it's not going well and burning out a little bit instead of leaving to focus on something else for a bit.
