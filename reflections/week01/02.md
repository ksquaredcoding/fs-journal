## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
```
A pseudo class is used to target elements under certain conditions. Most common I think are hover, visited, and active
```
2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
```
Specificity is what css properties take precedence. I could use it by knowing I can change specific things on a button with an id so it doesn't take on everything from its parent
```
3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
```
classes that overlap eachother and break things. If !important is on everything then nothing is !important.
