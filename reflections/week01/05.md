# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

Figuring out how to lay out websites with rows and columns and taking advantage of flex boxes.
```
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
```
How simple it was to implement bootstrap and universal it was, you can notice the same design concepts on so many websites.
```
- What are you struggling with?
```
Better ways to maybe approach something like a card spilling over, or progress bars.

Coming out of the first week excited to continue growing my knowledge and feeling that this was the right path.
