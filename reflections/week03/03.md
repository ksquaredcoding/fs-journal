## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?
```
get and set - get if something is just trying to access the key - set if someone tries to change a value
```
2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?
```
A trap that returns what data you would want to retrieve
```
3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?
```
You can set up traps to make sure you don't get bad data or only give access to what you want to give access to. It also helps from having to have way too many functions in one file.
