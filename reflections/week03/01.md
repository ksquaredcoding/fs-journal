Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
```
HTML is the visual people see, app is how the functionality gets linked to the visual. The controller is how people interact and get functionality to work. The controller is connected to the service so it can performthe logic. The service is connected to the appstate to pull and update needed data. The model is connected to the appstate and stored there so it can be accessed across all of the necessary files.
