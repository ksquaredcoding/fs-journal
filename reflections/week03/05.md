# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
```
Learning MVC model and understanding why things are broken up the way they are.
```
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
```
That functions can exist privately in a way that only the developer can access them which is nice.
```
- What are you struggling with?
```
Certain styling or placement of style elements and organizing things in a different way
```
- What would you count as a victory?
```
Being able to see a bit of where we will grow from here and seeing how vanilla js knowledge feeds nicely going forward.
