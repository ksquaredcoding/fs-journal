## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
```
Values hold data and actual values of things, You can pull values over and can be non destructively changed.
Reference are pulled over from another file and shown as a proxy. Pointer just does exactly that, points to a value to direct over.
```
2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
```
bool
byte
char
decimal
double
enum
float
int
long
sbyte
short
struct
uint
ulong
ushort

Many are similar to js.
```
3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
```
They store value in initial creation spot, and then are stored as proxies where they are needed. Values are created as copies and can exist fully on their own in each space.
```

```
Giving types to everything ahead of time makes it very simple to know what is stored and what you are doing in each spot.
