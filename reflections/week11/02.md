## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`
```
Primary key is main ref for objects in a table, foreign represents primary on a different now connected table
```
2. What is an `Alias`?
```
Shaping the data that comes back to fit a different model
```
3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:
```
SELECT
d.*,
p.*  
FROM doctors d
JOIN patients p ON p.doctorId = d.id
WHERE d.id = @id
```
```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```
